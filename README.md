# Guidelines for the implementation of adaptive retransmission scheme for contention-based protocols including Aloha and CSMA.

### Brief description: 
Due to the limited capacity and high propagation delay of underwater communication channels, contention-based media access control
(MAC) protocols suffer from a low packet delivery ratio (PDR) and a high end-to-end (E2E) delay in underwater acoustic sensor networks due to
the reliance on packet retransmission for reliable data delivery. In order to address the problem of low performance, we propose a novel adaptive
retransmission scheme, named ARS, which dynamically selects an optimal value of the maximum number of retransmissions, such that the successful
delivery probability of a packet is maximized for a given network load. ARS can be used for various contention-based protocols and hybrid MAC
protocols that have contention periods. ARS is applied to well-known contention-based protocols, Aloha and CSMA. Simulation results
show that ARS can achieve signiÔ¨Åcant performance improvement in terms of PDR and E2E delay over original MAC protocols.
